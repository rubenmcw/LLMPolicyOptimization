        <p>
          We will implement and extend the method from Bosio et al. (2025), which automatically
          synthesizes robot controllers as short, interpretable Python programs generated by a large
          language model (LLM). For each generated controller program, we will tune its numerical
          constants (e.g., gains and thresholds) using gradient-free optimization to maximize
          closed-loop performance. Our work will focus on an end-to-end replication in a 3D robot
          simulator (MuJoCo), including a full evaluation harness, code sandboxing, program
          parameterization (replacing numeric literals with a tunable parameter vector), and an
          iterative database-driven search loop. After replication, we will explore improvements
          such as robustness-aware tuning via domain randomization and comparing alternative
          black-box optimization methods (e.g., Bayesian Optimization, CMA-ES) to the paper’s
          baseline. Finally, we will integrate the resulting policies into ROS 2 as a controller
          node and, if feasible, demonstrate the best policy on a low-risk hardware platform with
          conservative safety limits.

            We split into two teams:
            <br /><br />
            Ruben and Jai are working on understanding the codebase.
            <br /><br />
            Hector and Leif are working on researching how to run the simulations/hardware
            experiments.
            <br /><br />
            This is part of the first "Research" phase.
